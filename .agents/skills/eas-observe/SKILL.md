description: EAS service (paid). Use for anything related to EAS Observe - adding `expo-observe` to an Expo project (AppMetricsRoot/ObserveRoot HOC, markInteractive, the useObserve hook, the Expo Router / React Navigation integrations for per-route metrics, and user-defined events via `Observe.logEvent`), querying via the EAS CLI (`eas observe:metrics-summary`, `observe:metrics`, `observe:routes`, `observe:events`, `observe:versions`), or interpreting the resulting metrics (cold/warm launch, TTR, TTI, navigation cold/warm TTR, update download, and the TTI frameRate params for triaging slow startups).

# EAS Observe

> **EAS service - costs apply.** EAS Observe is a paid Expo Application Services product with free-tier limits. Ingesting and querying production metrics counts against your plan's event/usage allowance. Review https://expo.dev/pricing before enabling it in production.

EAS Observe tracks startup, navigation, and custom-event performance from production Expo apps.

> **Source of truth:** https://docs.expo.dev/eas/observe/ — always consult the canonical docs when API details matter, especially get-started, configuration, integrations, and the metrics reference. EAS Observe is evolving; this skill's references are written to stay accurate but may lag the docs.

## Which reference to read

The three reference files in `./references/` cover the three things people typically need this skill for:

- **Adding EAS Observe to a project** → [`./references/setup.md`](./references/setup.md). Install, wrap the root layout (`AppMetricsRoot` on SDK 55, `ObserveRoot` on SDK 56+), call `markInteractive()` (global on SDK 55, via the `useObserve()` hook on SDK 56+), optional per-route navigation metrics through the Expo Router / React Navigation integrations, and user-defined events via `Observe.logEvent` (SDK 56+).
- **Querying metrics from the terminal** → [`./references/queries.md`](./references/queries.md). The five `eas observe:*` commands — `metrics-summary`, `metrics`, `routes`, `events`, `versions` — with flags, table layouts, JSON shapes, and common workflows.
- **Reading a dashboard or CLI output** → [`./references/metrics.md`](./references/metrics.md). Target thresholds per metric, what the TTI `frameRate.*` params mean, and diagnostic patterns for telling slow-but-smooth startup apart from main-thread contention or hard blocks.
